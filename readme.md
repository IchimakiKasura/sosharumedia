# sosharumedia [discontinued]

## this project is orginally created on July 6, 2020.

### I created it for fun and for my friends testing my skills doing simple front-end/back-end developing. It was hard so yeah I'm leaving it on my repository to preserve or idk saved forever. 
<br/>

### I'm still new on doing this kind of project `HTML,PHP,JS,MYSQL` at the same time to create this epic social website.
<br/>

### I stopped because I lack on the security side of the website（\*＾-＾\*）Like its easily XSS vulnurable so yeah. I did create another one with working comments but still easily can XSS by a random ppl.
